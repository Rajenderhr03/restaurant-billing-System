This is a Restaurant Ordering and Billing System, which includes two windows: Admin Window and Chef Window. These windows handle the process of taking orders from customers, processing the order, and delivering it. Restaurant billing system is very much needed. It is found that the billing system and maintenance of records of the cashier is done manually using a file-based method in some restaurants. Therefore, we gave our attention to avoid this weakness by building a computerized system to replace the file-based system that will help the restaurant to give a more efficient, effective, productive service to the customer. It reduces a lot of hard work and complexity. Nowadays restaurant is filled with people so it’s very difficult to manage all the work manually. That’s why this kind of software’s are required. Main objective was to develop a computerized system to store and retrieve billing records of customers. To computerize the file-based system I designed a system which enables easy access to billing records and restaurant records etc. This application is built in Python to maintain the orders and calculate the prices of orders at the restaurant. It allows a user to calculate the price, subtotal, taxes and total amount of the order by managing the quantities and prices of the items.
