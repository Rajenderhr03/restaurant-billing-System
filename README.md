This is a Restaurant Ordering and Billing System, which includes two windows: Admin Window and Chef Window. These windows handle the process of taking orders from customers, processing the order, and delivering it. Restaurant billing system is very much needed. It is found that the billing system and maintenance of records of the cashier is done manually using a file-based method in some restaurants. Therefore, we gave our attention to avoid this weakness by building a computerized system to replace the file-based system that will help the restaurant to give a more efficient, effective, productive service to the customer. It reduces a lot of hard work and complexity. Nowadays restaurant is filled with people so it’s very difficult to manage all the work manually. That’s why this kind of software’s are required. Main objective was to develop a computerized system to store and retrieve billing records of customers. To computerize the file-based system I designed a system which enables easy access to billing records and restaurant records etc. This application is built in Python to maintain the orders and calculate the prices of orders at the restaurant. It allows a user to calculate the price, subtotal, taxes and total amount of the order by managing the quantities and prices of the items.

A special feature of this system is the login method which requires a username and a password which increases the security of the stored data. Throughout the system we gave special attention to build interfaces that are user friendly which will make our system a successful one. In the context of the admin-Chef Restaurant Management system, there are two primary access options available: registration on the signup page and login via the graphical user interface (GUI).

Registration: Users, specifically Admins and Chefs, have the option to register on the signup page. This involves providing essential information to create an account.

Login: For those who are already registered, access to the system is granted through the login process via the GUI. The workflow of the system is as follows:
When a customer arrives at the restaurant, they interact with the Receptionist, who initiates the process.
The Admin, responsible for overseeing restaurant operations, logs into the software. If the Admin has an existing account, they can directly enter their Username and Password to access the system.

Upon successful login, the dashboard screen is displayed. This screen provides an overview of the current orders. The Admin can use this dashboard to record new customer orders, input relevant details, and calculate the order amount.
